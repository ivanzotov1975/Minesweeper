<h1>Minesweeper .NET 6</h1>
<p>
    Test project with well known MS game.
</p>

<p>
    Using .NET 6 and Win Forms and buttons as cells. <br />
    <code>Button.Tag</code> used to store aditional object for each cell (with position 'Row' 'Column' and states).<br />
    Generally is very slow rendering.<br />
    Will continue with other object for cell.<br />
